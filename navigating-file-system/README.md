### project:
## navigating-file-system

### description:
Java program that demonstrates navigating file systems, reading from files, and writing to files using the specified classes from java.io;

### Program Overview:
- Navigate File System: The program will prompt the user to enter a directory path.
- Read from File: It will read the contents of a specified text file within that directory.
- Write to File: It will write new content to another text file or append to an existing file.


#### task:
Given a scenario involving navigating file systems, reading from files, or writing to
files, develop the correct solution using the following classes (sometimes in combination),
from java.io: BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, File, FileReader, FileWriter, PrintWriter,
and Console.

### Explanation of the Code:
- Console Class: We use Console to read user input from the command line.
- File Class: We handle file and directory paths using the File class.
- BufferedReader: To read text from a file efficiently, we use a BufferedReader.
- BufferedWriter: For writing to a file, either creating or overwriting it, we utilize BufferedWriter.
- PrintWriter: It is used to append content to a file.

### How to Run the Program:
* 1 Copy the code into a file named FileManager.java.
* 2 Compile the program: javac FileManager.java
* 3 Run the program: java FileManager
* 4 Follow the prompts in the console to interact with the file system.

### conclusion:
This program allows you to navigate a file system, read from and write to files, using several classes from the java.io package.
